<h2>Version 3.5.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Shortcuts can now be configured to show up as Direct Share targets (on Android 11 and up only).

It is very likely that new bugs were introduced or that things no longer work the same way they did before. If you encounter any issue, please let me know, either by contacting me (see the &quot;Contact Developer&quot; option on the Information screen) or by opening a Github issue.</p><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>The app's UI was migrated to Material Design 3</li><li>New variable type <code>timestamp</code> was added, which reflects the current date and/or time</li><li>When using images for a shortcut's request body or form parameters, you now have the option to crop and rotate the image first</li><li>The Scripting editor as well as the cURL import screen now have syntax highlighting for easier editing</li><li>The input field for the request body text now supports syntax highlighting for JSON, XML and HTML. In addition, there is now a button that allows you to format your JSON.</li><li>You can now configure Certificate Pinning. You'll find the option for this on the Settings screen.</li><li>If a shortcut is configured to store the HTTP response into a file, it will now write that file directly instead of first storing the response into an internal file</li><li>The cancelling of a shortcut (e.g. via the back button) is now tracked in the Event History</li><li>When picking the color for an icon you now see a preview of the icon in that color</li><li>The Event History now also shows a timestamp's seconds when the event is expanded</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Previously, when importing shortcuts, it was only possible to import shortcuts that were exported by the same or an older version of the app. It is now possible to also import shortcuts from a newer version, provided compatibility can be guaranteed.</li><li>The Event History was moved out of the main menu into the Troubleshooting section on the Settings screen</li><li>The feature for moving shortcuts was reworked. It is now easier to move shortcuts between categories.</li><li>The recursion limits for shortcuts triggering other shortcuts were loosened. Previously, the execution would be cancelled after 5 recursion steps, now instead it will just include an artificial delay after 10 steps. This gives you more control and flexibility and still allows you to manually cancel an accidental infinite loop.</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>When displaying an HTTP response, the charset provided in the response headers is now taken into account instead of always defaulting to UTF-8</li><li>Text with variable placeholders in it can now be copied from one field to another without losing the placeholders</li><li>In the Scripting feature, putting block comments around a piece of code that contains variable placeholders no longer leads to syntax errors during execution</li><li>The MDNS host resolution now no longer just waits without doing anything and might actually resolve the host</li></ul><h3>Removed</h3><ul><li>The app no longer supports different themes and instead just uses one default theme.</li><li>It is no longer possible to use the homescreen's wallpaper as the background for a category. This has the advantage that the app no longer requires the permission to access the file system.</li></ul><h2>Version 2.31.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>You can now configure a shortcut to automatically store the HTTP response body into a file</li><li>When creating a home screen shortcut to a category, you can now choose an icon for it</li><li>When parsing CURL commands, the <code>--data-raw</code> flag is now supported</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Minor change to the order in which variables are resolved when executing a shortcut: When a variable references another variable, the referenced variable is now resolved immediately afterwards instead of at the end</li><li>If a shortcut is simple enough (i.e., no Scripting, variables, use of files, ...), it will now launch faster and with less UI flashing when triggered from the quick settings tile</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed an error message popping up occasionally when combining Scripting, repetition and the &quot;Wait for internet&quot; feature in a single shortcut</li><li>When selecting a content-type from the suggestions popup, it is now properly stored instead of sometimes being ignored</li></ul><h2>Version 2.30.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>There is now basic functionality to run a shortcut repeatedly on a fixed interval.</li><li>You can now share text from Scripting via the newly added <code>shareText()</code> function.</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>When displaying a JSON formatted response, special characters are no longer HTML encoded</li><li>The <code>base64encode()</code> function no longer appends unnecessary trailing newline characters</li><li>When using the <code>sendIntent()</code> function, you can now set the &quot;dataType&quot; parameter without having to also set the &quot;dataUri&quot; parameter.</li></ul><h2>Version 2.29.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>You can now log custom events into the Event History via the <code>logEvent()</code> function, allowing for better troubleshooting</li><li>The <code>setVariable()</code> function now allows you to change the stored value of a variable while still allowing the variable to be resolved normally afterwards. Simply pass <code>true</code> as the third parameter. This is useful if you want to change the preset / previously used value of a variable for which &quot;Remember value&quot; is enabled.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>The Event History will now heuristically try to remove tokens and secrets from the HTTP headers it displays</li><li>The Privacy Policy can now be accessed more easily through the built-in documentation</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Tables in the built-in documentation are now properly displayed</li><li>Fixed a crash when trying to edit a shortcut with device language set to Spanish</li></ul><h2>Version 2.28.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>When dealing with image files, you now have access to some meta data such as orientation and time of creation via the Scripting feature</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>A number of minor tweaks to animations and behavior improvements for text fields</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>The app no longer shows up in Recent Apps after a shortcut was executed</li><li>Fixed a bug where under certain circumstances shortcuts would always fail when variable values were too large</li></ul><h2>Version 2.27.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>The new &quot;Event History&quot; feature allows you to see details about recently executed shortcuts, their HTTP requests and responses, which you can use for troubleshooting.</li><li>You can now use the <code>setResult()</code> function in Scripting to pass data back to <code>executeShortcut()</code> or to Tasker</li><li>It is now possible to enable a secondary launcher app, which can be used to trigger shortcuts. This allows for workarounds on devices that can't make use of home screen shortcuts or widget.</li><li>Switching to other apps and back while a shortcut is executing is now possible</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>All variables are now resolved lazily, i.e., as late as possible and only when needed. The main difference this might make for you is that if you use <code>getVariable</code> or <code>setVariable</code> in a shortcut's &quot;Run before Execution&quot; Scripting, the order in which your variables are resolved might be different from before.</li><li>Additional documentation for some more advanced or hidden feature is now available</li><li>Clean-up work running in the background is now more considerate with memory and battery use</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Being unable to resolve a host is now treated as a regular error again, instead of an unexpected error</li><li>For streaming URLs (e.g. EventStream URLs), reaching the read timeout is no longer considered an error</li></ul><h2>Version 2.26.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Added support for SOCKS proxies</li><li>Added <code>promptPassword()</code>, <code>promptColor()</code>, <code>promptDate()</code> and <code>promptTime()</code> functions to Scripting feature</li><li>Added lots of translations. Much of it was machine translated so it might not be accurate, feedback for improvements is welcome</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added better validation for shortcut import to better support externally edited or generated export files</li><li>The default color in the color picker is now white instead of black to make it possible to pick a new color without touching the brightness slider</li><li>The <code>hmac()</code> function now also accepts messages in byte array format instead of only strings</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash when clicking the &quot;Share&quot; button on the response dialog</li><li>Fixed an issue where HTTP requests would fail when battery saver or data saver was enabled</li><li>Fixed the handling of arguments passed to <code>sendMqttMessages()</code></li><li>Parameter-based request body is now also included when a custom content-type header is provided</li></ul><h2>Version 2.25.1</h2><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Widgets no longer trigger the wrong shortcut when clicked</li><li>App no longer crashes when using multiple choice variables</li></ul><h2>Version 2.25.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>It is now possible to use the newly added &quot;executeShortcut&quot; function to have a shortcut trigger another shortcut to execute immediately and use its response in Scripting</li><li>You can now use the Scripting feature to send TCP packets and MQTT messages</li><li>Simple shortcuts now automatically run in &quot;headless mode&quot;, meaning that the HTTP request is done in the background instead of you having to look at the loading indicator until the request is complete</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Support for Ipack icons was removed</li><li>Many big changes under the hood, so there's a good chance some new bugs snuck in. Please let me know if you encounter any.</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>In many cases, triggering shortcuts from 3rd party apps wasn't working anymore on Android 13. This should now be fixed.</li><li>When using the Remote Editor, global scripting code is now correctly pulled instead of being ignored in some cases</li><li>When configuring a shortcut to run silently (i.e., neither response nor errors are displayed), the checkboxes for selecting the available actions are no longer shown, as they have no effect</li></ul><h2>Version 2.24.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>You can now choose which action buttons are displayed on the fullscreen window that displays the HTTP response: rerun, share, copy, and save to file</li><li>Improved interaction with 3rd party camera apps, even when they're not playing by the rules</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added a '#' to the color picker dialog to make it clearer that it asks for an RGB hex value</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed the F-Droid build once again</li></ul><h2>Version 2.23.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>When using the &quot;Dialog&quot; response display type, you can now choose to add a Copy, Share or Rerun button to the dialog</li><li>All color pickers in the app now show you the RGB hex code for the selected color and allow picking a color by entering a new code</li><li>When picking a custom color for a built-in icon, the color picker will now remember the previously used color, making it easier to use the same color for multiple shortcuts</li><li>All documentation is now bundled into the app, allowing you to read it even when offline and without having to leave the app</li><li>It is now possible to set up the quick settings tile directly from the settings screen (Android 13 only)</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Shortcut executions now always run in the foreground, which makes them more stable and avoids issues on Android 13</li><li>When using Multiple Choice variables with multiple selectable values, the result now reflects the order in which the options were selected</li><li>Added a mechanism to break the app out of an infinite loop of shortcuts triggering other shortcuts</li><li>Added support for themed icons (Android 13 only)</li><li>Rearranged the settings a bit for more clarity</li><li>Re-added the language picker</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Shortcuts with a delay are no longer delayed twice in a row when triggered from a Multi-Shortcut or via <code>enqueueShortcut()</code></li><li>Browser shortcuts, Multi-shortcuts, and Scripting shortcuts no longer show the &quot;Wait for connection&quot; option, as it has no effect for them</li><li>Launcher shortcuts are now properly updated when shortcuts are duplicated or deleted</li></ul><h2>Version 2.22.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>When picking a built-in icon which consists of only one color, it is now possible to pick a custom color for it. This replaces the predefined colored circle icons.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added some minor UI animations to the shortcut editor to make it clearer when new input elements become available</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Variable and shortcut placeholders in Scripting can now be properly deleted via the backspace key, which previously occasionally would not work</li><li>It is now possible to fetch the favicon for a shortcut even when the shortcut's URL contains variable placeholders</li><li>When editing a shortcut and only changing the &quot;Require Confirmation&quot; checkbox, the Save button now appears as expected</li></ul><h2>Version 2.21.1</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Improved support for navigating the app with a DPAD or arrow keys, for better TV support</li><li>When sharing files into the app, a loading indicator is now displayed while the files are being processed</li><li>There is now some debouncing to avoid accidentally executing the same shortcut twice in a row</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>The language selector is temporarily removed from the app, as a side-effect of a mitigation of another bug. Hopefully it will be back soon.</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Selecting text from the HTTP response in the fullscreen window no longer crashes the app</li><li>The menu on the Import/Export screen no longer shows a &quot;Sort&quot; option which doesn't do anything</li></ul><h2>Version 2.21.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Dialogs now support the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>-HTML-tag, allowing you to display images e.g., via the <code>showDialog()</code> function.

Going forward, older versions of Android will no longer receive updates. You can still install older versions of the app by <a href="https://github.com/Waboodoo/HTTP-Shortcuts/releases">downloading the APK directly from Github</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, this version introduces a breaking change to the Scripting feature, specifically to the built-in <code>hmac</code> and <code>base64decode</code> functions. The return type of these functions is now <code>Uint8Array</code> (i.e., an array of bytes) instead of a hex string. See the <strong>Scripting</strong> section below for more information.</p><h3>Scripting</h3><ul><li>The <code>base64encode</code> and <code>hmac</code> functions now also accept <code>Uint8Array</code> (byte arrays) as input, instead of only strings</li><li>The <code>hmac</code> and <code>base64decode</code> functions now return <code>Uint8Array</code> (byte arrays) instead of a hex encoded string</li><li>There are 2 new functions <code>toString</code> and <code>toHexString</code> which allow to convert <code>Uint8Array</code> into strings</li><li>The Code Snippet picker now also allows easily adding &quot;if { }&quot; and &quot;if { } else { }&quot; blocks</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>The &quot;Misc Settings&quot; section was renamed to &quot;Trigger &amp; Execution Settings&quot;</li><li>Some error messages, in particular around import &amp; export, were improved</li><li>The color picker dialog for <code>Color</code> variables was swapped out for a different, easier-to-use component</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes:</h3><ul><li>The response headers can now be properly accessed again via Scripting</li><li>Form parameters can now have empty values</li></ul><h2>Version 2.9.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Added <code>wakeOnLan</code> function to allow sending magic packets to wake up devices on the network</li><li>When using Scripting, JavaScript errors now also include the line number for easier debugging</li><li>The <code>triggerShortcut</code> function now supports a 3rd argument which can be used to specify a custom delay (in milliseconds)</li><li>Multiple Choice variables can now be configured to allow selecting multiple options</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Prepared the app for compatibility with Android 12</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>The <code>triggerShortcut</code> function can now be used to re-trigger the current shortcut itself, and do so indefinitely for as long as a delay larger than 500 milliseconds is specified.</li></ul><h2>Version 2.8.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>When only one shortcut is configured for the use in the Quick Settings Tile, the tile will assume the name of the shortcut instead of displaying &quot;Execute Shortcut&quot;</li><li>Shortened deep-link URLs so they better fit on NFC tags and small QR codes</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>When importing from cURL, the method is now set to POST when there is a request body, instead of falling back to GET and ignoring the body</li><li>When using the &quot;Number Input&quot; variable type, it is no longer possible to enter invalid numbers</li><li>When editing variables, the checkbox values are now also taken into account when detecting whether there are unsaved changes</li></ul><h2>Version 2.7.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Categories can now be pinned to the home screen, allowing faster access</li><li>Category tabs can now be long-pressed to go to the category settings</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>When exporting a single shortcut via sharing, only that shortcut is exported instead of all shortcuts</li><li>Better error handling for devices that don't offer an image picker</li></ul><h2>Version 2.6.0</h2><h3>Improvements</h3><ul><li>Shortcuts can now be re-ordered within a category by dragging</li><li>Basic support for Zeroconf/Bonjour/mDNS (.local domains)</li><li>Added troubleshooting option to improve Tasker integration.

It should now work more reliably, in particular in terms of passing around variables.
Unfortunately, this is a <strong>breaking change</strong>, so most likely you will need to re-configure your Tasker tasks, if you have any. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added TLSv1.3 support also for older Android versions</li><li>Added option to use a .p12 file directly for client certificate authentication</li><li>Added function <code>playSound</code> which allows playing a notification sound</li><li>Added info dialog for easier lookup for a shortcut's ID or deep-linking URL</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed broken special characters when using Basic Authentication, now uses UTF-8</li></ul><h2>Version 2.3.0</h2><h3>Client Certificate Authentication</h3><p>There is now the option to configure a shortcut to use a client certificate for authentication. You'll find the option in the shortcut's <em>Advanced Settings</em> section.</p><h3>Improved Import &amp; Export</h3><p>When exporting shortcuts and variables, the resulting file is now a ZIP file instead of a raw JSON file. This has the advantage that custom icons are now also exported and automatically become part of the exported bundle, and of course they can be imported again as well.</p><p>The Import and Export functionality was moved out of the general settings screen and into its own dedicated screen to make it easier to discover and use.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added <code>hmac</code> function, which allows computing the HMAC of a message.

fine-grained control over how the HTTP response should be handled and displayed when a
shortcut is executed. For example, it is now possible to display a custom message instead of
the default &quot;Shortcut executed.&quot; message.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>It is now possible to export individual shortcuts.</li><li>The <em>showDialog()</em> action now supports &lt;a&gt; and &lt;pre&gt; tags</li></ul><h2>Version 1.34.0</h2><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added Korean translation</li><li>Added function to send arbitrary Intents</li><li>Added function to trigger Tasker tasks</li><li>Added option to force requests to run in foreground to deal with device restrictions</li><li>Added support for --get/-G flag in cURL parser</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed arrow keys in scripting editor</li></ul><h2>Version 1.33.0</h2><h3>Scripting Improvements</h3><ul><li>Redesigned the code snippet picker to make it easier to navigate</li><li>Added <em>getWifiIPAddress()</em> helper function (thanks <a href="https://github.com/2219160052">@wahaha</a>)</li><li>Added <em>wait()</em> helper function</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Requests with file parameters (form-data) or files as request body now correctly include a Content-Length header</li><li>Fixed bug where the response was not available for scripting when code was executed before the request</li><li>Fixed bug where shortcuts couldn't be placed on the home screen using the &quot;Legacy&quot; placement method</li><li>Don't show Text-to-speech option when device does not support it</li></ul><h2>Version 1.32.0</h2><h3>Multi-Shortcuts</h3><p>You can now create a special type of shortcut which allows you to easily trigger multiple
other shortcuts without having to write special code for it.</p><h3>Scripting Improvements</h3><p>There is now a special type of shortcut which makes it easier to write custom logic through
scripting without making an actual HTTP request. Additionally, it is now also easier to
set up scripting actions which interact with or modify other shortcuts (e.g. to trigger or
rename them or change their icon).</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>The app now has a new logo</li><li>You can now use a file as the request body</li><li>Added a text-to-speech action which allows to read out a snippet of text.
Find it in the code snippet picker.</li><li>Added Hungarian as a language (thanks Dezső Gergely)</li><li>Added 6 new built-in icons</li><li>All pickers which offer a selection of shortcuts now also show their icon, e.g. when sharing text or a file into the app</li><li>Renamed &quot;variable key&quot; to &quot;variable name&quot; for clarity</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed permission error when sharing a file into the app to be used as a file parameter</li><li>The same shortcut can now be triggered multiple times</li><li>Hidden categories no longer show the options to change layout or background</li></ul><h2>Version 1.31.0</h2><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Drastically reduced the size of the app</li><li>Improved quality of most built-in icons.

See documentation for more information.</li><li>When exporting, unnecessary and redundant fields are excluded from the export to make it smaller in size and easier to read</li><li>Variable types can no longer be changed after creation</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed widget creation on Android 10 which would previously result in a crash</li><li>Variable placeholders are now replaced with their respective values when using cURL export</li></ul><h2>Version 1.30.0</h2><h3>Widgets!</h3><p>The app now has a (somewhat) customizable widget. This provides an alternative to regular
home screen shortcuts and has the benefit that they can be customized more freely (size,
label color, etc.).</p><p>Please note that this feature is in an early stage. More customization options will
come in a future release.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added a language picker to allow changing the language of the app. If your language is
not there, is incomplete or wrong, please feel free to help me out with the translations.</li><li>Improved validation of inputs for better error messages</li><li>When deleting variables a warning is shown if they are still in use by a shortcut</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed crashes that sometimes happened when importing or exporting</li><li>Fixed a bug where shortcuts would sometimes not properly trigger other shortcuts</li></ul><h2>Version 1.29.0</h2><h3>File Parameters</h3><p>You can now add file parameters to your shortcuts, which allows to send one or multiple
files as part of a request. Triggering a shortcut with a file parameter will open a file
picker to select which file to send. Alternatively you can share a file from another app
to trigger a shortcut, similar to how it was already possible to share text values from
other apps to be used as a value for a variable.</p><h3>Response Debugging</h3><p>There is now an additional option for how to display the response of an HTTP request, which
displays the response body in a fullscreen window but also displays additional meta information
such as response headers, status code and the response time. This should make it easier to
set up or debug shortcuts.</p><h3>User Interaction in Scripting</h3><p>You can now use <em>alert()</em>, <em>prompt()</em> and <em>confirm()</em> as part of the scripting
feature to create flows that require user interaction. These 3 functions work the same way
as you'd expect from a browser.</p><h3>Proxy Support</h3><p>It is now possible to specify an HTTP proxy for each shortcut. Check the &quot;Advanced Technical
Settings&quot; section when creating or editing a shortcut.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Triggering another shortcut when using scripting is now more reliable and much faster</li><li>HTTP response is ignored if it's not needed, for better performance</li><li>More meaningful error messages are displayed when importing fails</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Import and export now work as expected on Android 10 and no longer require Storage permission</li><li>URLs are trimmed to avoid leading and trailing whitespace characters</li><li>Duplicating shortcuts generates correct names</li></ul><h2>Version 1.28.0</h2><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Response handling and scripting options are now logically separated for clarity</li><li>Improved Chinese and Italian translation</li><li>Improved error handling for importing, exporting and when features are not supported on the device</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Content-Type header no longer includes a charset unless explicitly specified</li><li>Shortcuts on launcher icon are kept up-to-date more reliably</li></ul><h2>Version 1.27.0</h2><h3>Quick Settings Tile</h3><p>The app now has a Quick Settings Tile, which can be used to trigger a shortcut without opening the app and without
going to the home screen. Simply enable the option for one or more shortcuts via the &quot;Misc Settings&quot; menu in the editor.</p><h3>Dynamically change icons</h3><p>There is now a new action &quot;changeIcon&quot; which can be used to change the icon of a shortcut before or after execution.

it only supports built-in icons.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Bearer Authentication can now be set up more easily, directly from the &quot;Authentication&quot; settings of a shortcut</li><li>Categories can now be hidden</li><li>Added option to change the title on the main toolbar in the app</li><li>Shortcuts can now be imported directly from a URL</li><li>Added 45 new built-in icons</li><li>Added <em>abort()</em> function that allows to cancel the execution of a shortcut</li><li>HTTP errors include the HTTP status message in addition to the status code for more clarity</li><li>Newly created shortcuts will show full response in toast by default instead of only simple toast</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Categories no longer show the wrong shortcuts after moving or deleting categories or after importing</li><li>App no longer crashes when HTTP response is too large</li><li>(Confirmation) dialogs have the correct colors now when dark mode is enabled</li><li>One shortcut can now trigger multiple other shortcuts (kinda... it's not quite smooth yet...)</li></ul><h2>Version 1.26.0</h2><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Better handling of empty responses</li><li>Added Russian translation</li><li>Made &quot;Help me Translate&quot; button more foolproof</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>GET requests can now have a <em>Content-Type</em> header</li><li>CURL export of GET requests no longer incorrectly sets method to POST</li><li>Variables can now be used in URLs again without triggering validation errors</li></ul><h2>Version 1.25.0</h2><h3>Dark Mode</h3><p>The app now has a dark theme. It can be enabled or disabled via the settings.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Increased font size of response</li><li>Improved value picker for timeout settings</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Variable changes in pre-request actions now properly affect the current execution</li><li>Execution now less likely to fail due to battery saver or data saver modes</li></ul><h2>Version 1.24.1</h2><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed Tasker integration</li><li>Fixed variable dialogs triggering when they should not</li><li>Fixed resolution of variables within variables</li><li>Fixed adding of variables to request body</li><li>Fixed a crash when setting delay to 1 second</li></ul><h2>Version 1.24.0</h2><h3>Redesigned Editor</h3><p>The editor for creating and editing shortcuts was completely redesigned. The many different options are now separated
into their own screens to make the UI easier to navigate.</p><h3>JavaScript Code Execution</h3><p>Previously you were able to add specific actions to be executed before or after a shortcut runs. Now, instead of a static list
of actions, you can run arbitrary JavaScript code, which allows for much more flexibility and more advanced workflows.
On top of that, there are now 2 new actions that can be called directly from within the JavaScript code:</p><ul><li>Added action to show a dialog window with text in it</li><li>Added action to copy text to the clipboard</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>HTML responses are shown in a web view instead of as plain text, allowing to include styling and formatting</li><li>Basic HTML formatting is now possible when using response type &quot;Dialog&quot; or &quot;showDialog&quot; action</li><li>Added option to have HTTP requests follow redirects</li><li>Increased maximum length for variables of type 'Constant' from 300 to 3000 characters</li><li>Loosened variable name restrictions: They may now contain underscores and be up to 30 characters long.</li><li>Added option to change the background of individual categories</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed bug where importing shortcuts would sometimes overwrite other existing shortcuts</li><li>Fixed requests with method DELETE or OPTIONS not sending a request body</li><li>Fixed zero or negative step sizes in variables of type 'Slider' crashing the app</li></ul><h2>Version 1.23.0</h2><h3>App Lock</h3><p>It is now possible to lock the app with a password, to prevent modification of shortcuts or
app settings.</p><h3>Require Confirmation</h3><p>There is now a new option that allows you to mark a shortcut as requiring confirmation.
These shortcuts will prompt you with a confirmation dialog before executing, thereby
preventing accidental execution.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>Added link to FAQ page</li><li>Added partial translation into Catalan</li><li>Added partial translation into Polish</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed shortcuts not working when Battery Saver or Data Saver enabled</li><li>Fixed crash when using form-data on Android Marshmallow or older</li><li>Fixed crash when deleting variable</li></ul><h2>Version 1.22.0</h2><h3>Shortcut Placement / Using in Other Apps</h3><p>You may have encountered a problem when trying to use shortcuts in other apps (e.g. Tasker),
where it would not select or make the other app crash. There is now an alternative method of
selecting a shortcut that you may try in this case. Simply retry selecting the shortcut and
you will be prompted with a dialog that asks you to pick either the new or the old method.</p><h3>Longer Timeouts</h3><p>It is now possible to have request timeouts of up to 10 minutes.</p><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li><p>Request body of <em>multipart/form</em> requests now correctly uses CRLF instead of only
LF</p></li><li><p>Fixed various rare app crashes</p></li></ul><h2>Version 1.21.0</h2><h3>Shortcut Actions</h3><p>You can now define what happens before and after a shortcut is executed. This includes
things like displaying a Toast message, extracting part of the response or triggering
another shortcut. More to come in future updates!</p><h3>Support for multipart/form-data</h3><p>In addition to sending a custom request body and simple parameters, it is now also possible
to send form data, i.e, using the &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; content type.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>New translations: Norwegian (Bokmål), Italian</li><li>Shortcut can be opened in browser</li><li>Improved syntax highlighting &amp; pretty printing of JSON &amp; XML responses</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Delayed execution &amp; waiting for network connectivity now work again</li><li>Custom icons now show on the home screen on Oreo</li><li>gzipped responses are now correctly parsed</li><li>Various occasional crashes</li></ul><h2>Version 1.20.0</h2><h3>Simplified Variable Insertion</h3><p>Inserting variables into shortcuts has now become much easier. Each input field that
supports variables now has a button next to it. Clicking it opens a popup dialog with a list
of all available variables, allowing you to easily pick and insert one.</p><h3>Improved Tasker Integration</h3><p>When triggering shortcuts from Tasker, it is now possible to send along variables. Simply
define variables with the same name in Tasker as in your shortcut and their value will
automatically be sent from Tasker to your shortcut when triggered.</p><h3>Drag &amp; Drop Reordering</h3><p>Categories &amp; Variables, as well as options of <em>select</em> &amp; <em>toggle</em> variables, can
now easily be reordered via drag &amp; drop.</p><h3>Improved Specification of Request Body</h3><p>When specifying the request body of a shortcut, you now have the option to chose between <em>x-www-form-urlencoded</em>,
i.e., the body is a list of parameters, or <em>custom text</em>, i.e., you specify the request
body as raw text and give it a content-type.</p><h3>Variables within Variables!</h3><p>The <em>constant</em>, <em>toggle</em> and <em>select</em> variable types now support recursive
resolution of values. This means you can reference other variables from these variables. For
example, you could set up a <em>select</em> variable where one of the options is a
<em>color</em> variable.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li><p>The input field for request parameter values now allows multiline input.</p></li><li><p>The cURL export dialog now includes a <em>copy</em> button to allow you to quickly copy
