<h1>Introduction</h1><h2>What is HTTP?</h2><p>HTTP (<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>T</strong>ransfer <strong>P</strong>rotocol) is a widely used protocol which forms the foundation of the web as we know it. It revolves around the concept of requesting resources (e.g. pages of a website or endpoints in a REST API), identified by a URL, from a server.</p><p>This app assumes that you're already familiar with the basics of the protocol, so in case you're not I suggest you get yourself an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">overview</a> first.</p><h2>What is this app about?</h2><p>The main goal of this app is to provide an easy way to send HTTP requests from an Android device. It achieves this by allowing you to create so called <a href="shortcuts.md">shortcuts</a> which can be clicked to trigger such a request, either from within the app directly or via a widget placed on your home screen.</p><p>Shortcuts can be grouped together into different <a href="categories.md">categories</a> which are shown as separate tabs inside the app.</p><p>In some cases you want do to more than just send a simple HTTP request but need more powerful tools for advanced workflows. This is where <a href="variables.md">variables</a> come in, which allow you to dynamically inject values into your request, and the <a href="scripting.md">scripting</a> capabilities of the app, which allow you to use JavaScript code snippets to further customize how your shortcuts behave.</p>
