<h1>Execution Flow</h1><p>When you click a shortcut, either on your home screen or within the app, it will execute. This means it will go through the following steps:</p><h2>1. Ask for Confirmation</h2><p>If you selected the <em>&quot;Require confirmation before execution&quot;</em> option for your shortcut, you will be asked to confirm in this step. If you select <em>&quot;Cancel&quot;</em> the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><h2>2. Check Wi-Fi SSID</h2><p>If you configured your shortcut to only run when on a specific Wi-Fi, this step will check whether that condition is met. If it is not, the remaining steps will not be executed and instead you will be prompted to switch Wi-Fis.</p><h2>3. Delay</h2><p>If you set your shortcut up to have a delay it will be applied in this step. E.g., if you selected that your shortcut should be delayed by 5 seconds then the app will wait for 5 seconds before executing the next steps.</p><h2>4. Resolve Files</h2><p>If your shortcut needs one or more files, e.g. for its request body or for a form parameter, they will be resolved in this step. You will be prompted with one or multiple file pickers.</p><p>If you cancel any of the file pickers then the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><h2>5. Run &quot;Global&quot; Script</h2><p>If you added any JavaScript code into the <em>&quot;Global Scripting&quot;</em> section in the app's settings then that code will execute in this step.</p><p>If the script fails (e.g., due to a syntax error) then an error message will be displayed and the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><p>For more details see the documentation on <a href="scripting.md">Scripting</a>.</p><h2>6. Run &quot;Before&quot; Script</h2><p>If you added any JavaScript code into the <em>&quot;Run before Execution&quot;</em> textarea in your shortcut's <em>&quot;Scripting&quot;</em> section (or your shortcut is a <em>Scripting</em> shortcut) then that code will be executed in this step.</p><p>If the script fails (e.g., due to a syntax error) then an error message will be displayed and the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><p>For more details see the documentation on <a href="scripting.md">Scripting</a>.</p><h2>7. Resolve Variables</h2><p>If you use any variables in your shortcut, they will be resolved in this step. E.g., if you used a variable of type <em>&quot;Color Input</em>&quot; you will be asked to pick a color, or if you have a variable of type <em>&quot;Text Input&quot;</em> you will be presented with a dialog window that asks you to enter a text value.</p><p>If you select <em>&quot;Cancel&quot;</em> on any of the variable resolution dialogs then the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><p>Note that it is possible for some variables to already be resolved before this step, e.g. if you ask for their value via Scripting in step 5 or 6 or if you explicitly passed a value for a variable when triggering the shortcut (which is possible when starting a shortcut via Intent, deep-link or Scripting).</p><p>For more information see the <a href="variables.md">Variables</a> documentation.</p><h2>8. Send HTTP Request</h2><p>In this step the actual HTTP request is sent and the response received.</p><p>If the request fails due to a network problem (e.g., because your device is not connected to the internet) and you selected the <em>&quot;Wait for connection when offline&quot;</em> option then it will be rescheduled at this point. Once a network connection is detected the execution will start over from step 5.</p><h2>9. Run &quot;Success&quot; or &quot;Failure&quot; Script</h2><p>If the HTTP request was a success (i.e., it completed with a 2xx response code, or a 3xx response code and following redirects was disabled) and if you added any JavaScript code into the <em>&quot;Run on Success&quot;</em> textarea in your shortcut's <em>&quot;Scripting&quot;</em> section then that code will be executed in this step.</p><p>Similarly, if the HTTP request failed (e.g., because of a network error or because of a 4xx or 5xx response code) and if you added any JavaScript code into the <em>&quot;Run on Failure&quot;</em> textarea in your shortcut's <em>&quot;Scripting&quot;</em> section then that code will be executed in this step.</p><p>If the script fails (e.g., due to a syntax error or runtime error) then an error message will be displayed and the remaining steps will not be executed.</p><p>For more details see the documentation on <a href="scripting.md">Scripting</a>.</p><h2>10. Store Response</h2><p>If you configured your shortcut to store the HTTP response into a file, that will happen in this step. A file is only created for a successful request.</p><h2>10. Display Result</h2><p>Depending on what options you picked in the <em>&quot;Response Handling&quot;</em> section of your shortcut, the response or a pre-defined message will be displayed in this final step, either as a toast, in a dialog window or a fullscreen window.</p><h2>11. Execute Next Shortcut</h2><p>If you called <a href="scripting.md#trigger-shortcut"><code>enqueueShortcut</code></a> at any point in the Scripting of your shortcut, that enqueued shortcut will now be executed, possibly after a delay if you specified one.</p>
