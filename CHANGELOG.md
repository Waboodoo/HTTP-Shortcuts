### Bugfixes
- In the cURL import & export, digest authentication now properly uses `--digest`

## Version 3.9.0

## Version 3.0.0

A lot of things were added, changed and reworked in this version. It is very likely that new bugs were introduced or that things no longer work the same way they did before. If you encounter any issue, please let me know, either by contacting me (see the "Contact Developer" option on the Information screen) or by opening a GitHub issue.

### Improvements
- The app's UI was migrated to Material Design 3
- New variable type `timestamp` was added, which reflects the current date and/or time
- When using images for a shortcut's request body or form parameters, you now have the option to crop and rotate the image first
- The Scripting editor as well as the cURL import screen now have syntax highlighting for easier editing

- You can now configure Certificate Pinning. You'll find the option for this on the Settings screen.
- If a shortcut is configured to store the HTTP response into a file, it will now write that file directly instead of first storing the response into an internal file
- The cancelling of a shortcut (e.g. via the back button) is now tracked in the Event History
- When picking the color for an icon you now see a preview of the icon in that color
- The Event History now also shows a timestamp's seconds when the event is expanded

### Miscellaneous
- Previously, when importing shortcuts, it was only possible to import shortcuts that were exported by the same or an older version of the app. It is now possible to also import shortcuts from a newer version, provided compatibility can be guaranteed.
- The Event History was moved out of the main menu into the Troubleshooting section on the Settings screen
- The feature for moving shortcuts was reworked. It is now easier to move shortcuts between categories.
- The recursion limits for shortcuts triggering other shortcuts were loosened. Previously, the execution would be cancelled after 5 recursion steps, now instead it will just include an artificial delay after 10 steps. This gives you more control and flexibility and still allows you to manually cancel an accidental infinite loop.

### Bugfixes
- When displaying an HTTP response, the charset provided in the response headers is now taken into account instead of always defaulting to UTF-8
- Text with variable placeholders in it can now be copied from one field to another without losing the placeholders
- In the Scripting feature, putting block comments around a piece of code that contains variable placeholders no longer leads to syntax errors during execution
- The MDNS host resolution now no longer just waits without doing anything and might actually resolve the host

### Removed
- The app no longer supports different themes and instead just uses one default theme.
- It is no longer possible to use the homescreen's wallpaper as the background for a category. This has the advantage that the app no longer requires the permission to access the file system.

## Version 2.31.0

### Improvements
- You can now configure a shortcut to automatically store the HTTP response body into a file
- When creating a home screen shortcut to a category, you can now choose an icon for it
- When parsing CURL commands, the `--data-raw` flag is now supported

### Miscellaneous
- Minor change to the order in which variables are resolved when executing a shortcut: When a variable references another variable, the referenced variable is now resolved immediately afterwards instead of at the end
- If a shortcut is simple enough (i.e., no Scripting, variables, use of files, ...), it will now launch faster and with less UI flashing when triggered from the quick settings tile

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an error message popping up occasionally when combining Scripting, repetition and the "Wait for internet" feature in a single shortcut
- When selecting a content-type from the suggestions popup, it is now properly stored instead of sometimes being ignored

## Version 2.30.0

### Improvements
- There is now basic functionality to run a shortcut repeatedly on a fixed interval.

- When using the `sendIntent()` function, you can now set the "dataType" parameter without having to also set the "dataUri" parameter.

## Version 2.29.0

### Improvements
- You can now log custom events into the Event History via the `logEvent()` function, allowing for better troubleshooting
- The `setVariable()` function now allows you to change the stored value of a variable while still allowing the variable to be resolved normally afterwards. Simply pass `true` as the third parameter. This is useful if you want to change the preset / previously used value of a variable for which "Remember value" is enabled.

### Miscellaneous
- The Event History will now heuristically try to remove tokens and secrets from the HTTP headers it displays
- The Privacy Policy can now be accessed more easily through the built-in documentation

- A number of minor tweaks to animations and behavior improvements for text fields

### Bugfixes
- The app no longer shows up in Recent Apps after a shortcut was executed
- Fixed a bug where under certain circumstances shortcuts would always fail when variable values were too large

## Version 2.27.0

### Improvements
- The new "Event History" feature allows you to see details about recently executed shortcuts, their HTTP requests and responses, which you can use for troubleshooting.
- You can now use the `setResult()` function in Scripting to pass data back to `executeShortcut()` or to Tasker
- It is now possible to enable a secondary launcher app, which can be used to trigger shortcuts. This allows for workarounds on devices that can't make use of home screen shortcuts or widget.
- Switching to other apps and back while a shortcut is executing is now possible

### Miscellaneous
- All variables are now resolved lazily, i.e., as late as possible and only when needed. The main difference this might make for you is that if you use `getVariable` or `setVariable` in a shortcut's "Run before Execution" Scripting, the order in which your variables are resolved might be different from before.
- Additional documentation for some more advanced or hidden feature is now available
- Clean-up work running in the background is now more considerate with memory and battery use

### Bugfixes
- Being unable to resolve a host is now treated as a regular error again, instead of an unexpected error
- For streaming URLs (e.g. EventStream URLs), reaching the read timeout is no longer considered an error

## Version 2.26.0

### Improvements
- Added support for SOCKS proxies
- Added `promptPassword()`, `promptColor()`, `promptDate()` and `promptTime()` functions to Scripting feature
- Added lots of translations. Much of it was machine translated so it might not be accurate, feedback for improvements is welcome

## Version 2.25.1

### Bugfixes
- Widgets no longer trigger the wrong shortcut when clicked
- App no longer crashes when using multiple choice variables

## Version 2.25.0

### Improvements
- It is now possible to use the newly added "executeShortcut" function to have a shortcut trigger another shortcut to execute immediately and use its response in Scripting
- You can now use the Scripting feature to send TCP packets and MQTT messages
- Simple shortcuts now automatically run in "headless mode", meaning that the HTTP request is done in the background instead of you having to look at the loading indicator until the request is complete

### Miscellaneous
- Support for Ipack icons was removed
- Many big changes under the hood, so there's a good chance some new bugs snuck in. Please let me know if you encounter any.

### Bugfixes

- All documentation is now bundled into the app, allowing you to read it even when offline and without having to leave the app
- It is now possible to set up the quick settings tile directly from the settings screen (Android 13 only)

### Miscellaneous

It now includes a new icon picker screen, which allows you to see all the icons you have used before and gives you the option to delete the ones you don't need anymore. In addition, you now have to open to download the favicon of a webpage and use that as the icon for your shortcut.

### Improvements
- In the Variables screen, it is now easier to find out which variables are unused.
- The Code Snippet Picker now contains an entry for the "trim()" function.
- When sharing text into variables, it is now possible to also receive the title being shared, not only the text.
- Changing the title in the app's main screen is now more discoverable via an option in the Settings screen

### Bugfixes
- Some text fields in the shortcut editor were misbehaving or not properly initialized. This is now fixed.
- Unusually large custom icons now just display an error instead of crashing the app
- In most places (not all yet, still work in progress) when a dialog is displayed and then the screen orientation changes, the dialog persists instead of being closed
- The Acknowledgments screen now respects dark mode
- Long pressing on shortcuts now no longer brings up the context menu while the app is locked
- The Settings screen no longer crashes when the screen orientation changes while a dialog is visible

## Version 2.13.1

### Bugfixes
- Deleted shortcuts can now be removed again from Multi-Shortcuts
- When exporting shortcuts and overwriting a file, the exported file no longer gets corrupted
- App no longer crashes when encountering a cookie without a value
- Added missing error handling for large responses
- Added missing loading states to some screens
- Improved resilience against crashes due to very large custom icons
- Fixed an issue with Indonesian translations and improved resilience against similar issues
- The state of the Acknowledgements screen is now preserved when the screen orientation changes

## Version 2.13.0

This version includes a massive refactoring under the hood, so there's a good chance that some new bugs or small changes in behavior were introduced. Please let me know if you find something unusual.

### Scripting
- The `setVariable` function can now be used to set the stored value of any type of variable, not only static/constant variables. This allows you to set the remembered value of a variable where the 'Remember value' option is enabled.
- Added functions `openApp` and `openUrl` to allow opening external apps more conveniently than by using `sendIntent` or a browser shortcut
- Added `getWifiSSID` function to allow querying the SSID of the currently connected Wi-Fi network
- Renamed `triggerShortcut` to `enqueueShortcut` to make it clearer what it does

### Miscellaneous
- Toast messages now support basic HTML tags for formatting
- Improved the UX for the Request Body input box
- Improved the internal data store, so that the app should take up a bit less storage on the device
- Improved text sizes and colors for better readability in various places
- Added Indonesian translation

### Bugfixes
- Quick Settings Tile shortcuts are now sorted alphabetically instead of appearing in no particular order
- Custom icons are now loaded asynchronously and more memory-efficiently, which should reduce the risk of running out of memory when loading many icons at once
- Fixed a deadlock that would happen when calling the `wait` function too many times
- Fixed crash on Android 12 when trying to open Wi-Fi selection screen
- Reduced likelihood of old response window showing up again when triggering a new shortcut
- Removed "Multiline" checkbox from Number Input and Password Input variable types as it had no effect and was never supposed to be there
- Improved the handling of large HTTP responses. The app is now less likely to crash when encountering these

## Version 2.12.0

### Miscellaneous
- Use https for new shortcuts by default
- Improved Android backup support
- Improved error messages in some places
- Rearranged the order of the icons in the built-in icon picker

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue with the `-d` parameter in cURL parsing
- 3xx status codes are now treated as a successful response instead of a failure

## Version 2.11.0

### Scripting
`response.headers` and `response.cookies` now return a list of strings instead of just a string. This is a breaking change, but it allows handling the case where there are multiple headers or cookies with the same name.

For convenience, there is now a `response.getHeader(headerName)` and a `response.getCookie(cookieName)` function which can be used to retrieve a specific header or cookie by name. If there are multiple headers or cookies with the given name, the last one will be returned.

### Miscellaneous
- When choosing an icon for a shortcut, it is now possible to select a custom icon that was previously used
- Added partial Japanese translation

### Bugfixes
- Passing variable values to a shortcut via the `triggerShortcut` now passes the correct values again, without an unwanted prefix
- Fixed incorrect error message of `wakeOnLan` function

## Version 2.10.0

### Important Changes
The minimum supported Android version is now at 5.0 (Lollipop). Going forward, older versions of Android will no longer receive updates. You can still install older versions of the app by [downloading the APK directly from GitHub](https://github.com/Waboodoo/HTTP-Shortcuts/releases).

Furthermore, this version introduces a breaking change to the Scripting feature, specifically to the built-in `hmac` and `base64decode` functions. The return type of these functions is now `Uint8Array` (i.e., an array of bytes) instead of a hex string. See the **Scripting** section below for more information.

### Scripting
- The `base64encode` and `hmac` functions now also accept `Uint8Array` (byte arrays) as input, instead of only strings
- The `hmac` and `base64decode` functions now return `Uint8Array` (byte arrays) instead of a hex encoded string
- There are 2 new functions `toString` and `toHexString` which allow to convert `Uint8Array` into strings
- The Code Snippet picker now also allows easily adding "if { }" and "if { } else { }" blocks

### Miscellaneous
- The "Misc Settings" section was renamed to "Trigger & Execution Settings"
- Some error messages, in particular around import & export, were improved
- The color picker dialog for `Color` variables was swapped out for a different, easier-to-use component

### Bugfixes:
- The response headers can now be properly accessed again via Scripting
- Form parameters can now have empty values

## Version 2.9.0

### Improvements
- Added `wakeOnLan` function to allow sending magic packets to wake up devices on the network
- When using Scripting, JavaScript errors now also include the line number for easier debugging
- The `triggerShortcut` function now supports a 3rd argument which can be used to specify a custom delay (in milliseconds)
- Multiple Choice variables can now be configured to allow selecting multiple options

### Miscellaneous
- Prepared the app for compatibility with Android 12

### Bugfixes
- The `triggerShortcut` function can now be used to re-trigger the current shortcut itself, and do so indefinitely for as long as a delay larger than 500 milliseconds is specified.

## Version 2.8.0

### Improvements
- When only one shortcut is configured for the use in the Quick Settings Tile, the tile will assume the name of the shortcut instead of displaying "Execute Shortcut"
- Shortened deep-link URLs so they better fit on NFC tags and small QR codes

### Bugfixes
- When importing from cURL, the method is now set to POST when there is a request body, instead of falling back to GET and ignoring the body
- When using the "Number Input" variable type, it is no longer possible to enter invalid numbers
- When editing variables, the checkbox values are now also taken into account when detecting whether there are unsaved changes


## Version 2.7.0

### Improvements
- Categories can now be pinned to the home screen, allowing faster access
- Category tabs can now be long-pressed to go to the category settings

### Bugfixes
- When exporting a single shortcut via sharing, only that shortcut is exported instead of all shortcuts
- Better error handling for devices that don't offer an image picker

## Version 2.6.0

### Improvements
- Shortcuts can now be re-ordered within a category by dragging
- Basic support for Zeroconf/Bonjour/mDNS (.local domains)
- Added troubleshooting option to improve Tasker integration. Enable it you find that triggering shortcuts from Tasker or other 3rd party apps doesn't work.

## Version 2.5.0

### Miscellaneous
- Added a "Rerun" button to the response window, allowing to easily execute a shortcut again
- Added option for multiline text input to the "Text Input" variable
- Added and improved some help texts throughout the app

### Bugfixes

- Tweaked the Tasker integration to more reliably execute shortcuts

## Version 2.4.0

### Important: Tasker Integration Overhaul
The integration with Tasker has been updated. It should now work more reliably, in particular in terms of passing around variables.
Unfortunately, this is a **breaking change**, so most likely you will need to re-configure your Tasker tasks, if you have any. Sorry for the inconvenience.

### Miscellaneous
- Added TLSv1.3 support also for older Android versions
- Added option to use a .p12 file directly for client certificate authentication
- Added function `playSound` which allows playing a notification sound
- Added info dialog for easier lookup for a shortcut's ID or deep-linking URL

### Bugfixes
- Fixed broken special characters when using Basic Authentication, now uses UTF-8

## Version 2.3.0

### Client Certificate Authentication
There is now the option to configure a shortcut to use a client certificate for authentication. You'll find the option in the shortcut's *Advanced Settings* section.

### Improved Import & Export
When exporting shortcuts and variables, the resulting file is now a ZIP file instead of a raw JSON file. This has the advantage that custom icons are now also exported and automatically become part of the exported bundle, and of course they can be imported again as well.

The Import and Export functionality was moved out of the general settings screen and into its own dedicated screen to make it easier to discover and use.

### Miscellaneous
- Added `hmac` function, which allows computing the HMAC of a message. Supported algorithms are md5, sha-1, sha-256 and sha-512.
- The "Number Slider" variable type now also supports negative numbers.
- Image responses can now also be displayed in the 'Dialog Window' option, not only with the 'Fullscreen Window' option

### Bugfixes

### Bugfixes
- When triggering the same shortcut multiple times but with different variable values, the values are preserved and passed correctly.

## Version 2.1.0

### Miscellaneous
- Browser Shortcuts are no longer limited to just HTTP(S) but can now use arbitrary URL schemes, allowing deep-linking into other apps.
- Improved some of the help texts to make it clearer how to use the app

- Fixed the displaying of the changelog dialog on app startup (so meta).
- Fixed detection of variable names in scripts when enclosed by single quotes instead of double quotes
- When unlocking app settings, the password prompt dialog no longer incorrectly pops up again when the correct password is entered.

## Version 2.0.0

### Response Handling
- When using the 'Window' UI type for displaying the response, it is now possible to save the response into a file.
- When using the 'Window' UI type for displaying the response and the response is an image, it will be displayed as such instead of displaying it as plain text.
- When the response is larger than the limit of 1MB, instead of failing, the request is treated as a success.
- When creating a new shortcut, the default way of displaying the response is via a window instead of a toast.

### Scripting
- When using the Code Snippet picker for the `changeIcons` action it is now possible to pick a custom image instead of only a built-in one.
- It is now possible to access the name, type and size of selected files via Scripting.
- The settings page now features a scripting editor which can be used to define a piece of code which is executed at the start of each shortcut, allowing to share code and define common variables and functions.

### Miscellaneous
- Shortcuts can now be limited to only execute when connected to a specific wifi (thanks [@crasu](https://github.com/crasu))
- The value input field for static (constant) variables is now multi-line, making it easier to enter or view larger values.
- It is now possible to trigger a specific shortcut by invoking a deep-link of the form `http-shortcuts://deep-link/<id-of-shortcut-here>`
- When displaying a JSON formatted response in a window, it is now possible to toggle line-wrapping by tapping.
- The `About` section was moved out of the `Settings` page to be a standalone page.

### Bugfixes
- Deleted shortcuts now show in the shortcut list of Multi-Shortcuts, making it possible to fully remove them manually.
- When a response is too large for sharing as text, instead of crashing or silently failing it will now try to share it as a file instead.
- When selecting files (for request parameters or body) their original file name is used instead of a generated or internal one.

## Version 1.39.0

### Remote Editing

You can now edit your shortcuts and categories from the comfort of a desktop computer. Go to "Settings > Edit on Computer" to find out more.

### Miscellaneous

- Increased maximum length of static variables (constants) from 3000 to 30000 characters
- Improved Polish translation

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a crash caused by invalid characters in User-Agent header

- Using getVariable() or setVariable() now raises an error when the variable doesn't exist instead of silently failing

## Version 1.38.0

### Scripting Improvements

There is now a *hash()* action, which allows to apply MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

## Version 1.35.0

### Improved "Response Handling"

The "Response Handling" section of the shortcut editor was redesigned to allow for more
fine-grained control over how the HTTP response should be handled and displayed when a
shortcut is executed. For example, it is now possible to display a custom message instead of
the default "Shortcut executed." message.

### Miscellaneous

- It is now possible to export individual shortcuts.
- The *showDialog()* action now supports &lt;a&gt; and &lt;pre&gt; tags

## Version 1.34.0

- Don't show Text-to-speech option when device does not support it

## Version 1.32.0

### Multi-Shortcuts

You can now create a special type of shortcut which allows you to easily trigger multiple
other shortcuts without having to write special code for it.

### Scripting Improvements

There is now a special type of shortcut which makes it easier to write custom logic through
scripting without making an actual HTTP request. Additionally, it is now also easier to
set up scripting actions which interact with or modify other shortcuts (e.g. to trigger or
rename them or change their icon).

### Miscellaneous

- The app now has a new logo
- You can now use a file as the request body
- Added a text-to-speech action which allows to read out a snippet of text.
Find it in the code snippet picker.

- Added 10 new built-in icons to choose from
- cURL import/export now supports Bearer authentication and proxy settings
- The color picker for "Color" variables now supports HSV mode in addition to RGB mode
- When using the 'triggerShortcut' action you can now pass along a set of variable values to the triggered shortcut. See documentation for more information.
- When exporting, unnecessary and redundant fields are excluded from the export to make it smaller in size and easier to read
- Variable types can no longer be changed after creation

### Bugfixes

- Fixed widget creation on Android 10 which would previously result in a crash
- Variable placeholders are now replaced with their respective values when using cURL export

## Version 1.30.0

### Widgets!

The app now has a (somewhat) customizable widget. This provides an alternative to regular
home screen shortcuts and has the benefit that they can be customized more freely (size,
label color, etc.).

Please note that this feature is in an early stage. More customization options will
come in a future release.

### Miscellaneous

- Added a language picker to allow changing the language of the app. If your language is
not there, is incomplete or wrong, please feel free to help me out with the translations.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed crashes that sometimes happened when importing or exporting
- Fixed a bug where shortcuts would sometimes not properly trigger other shortcuts

## Version 1.29.0

### File Parameters

You can now add file parameters to your shortcuts, which allows to send one or multiple
files as part of a request. Triggering a shortcut with a file parameter will open a file
picker to select which file to send. Alternatively you can share a file from another app
to trigger a shortcut, similar to how it was already possible to share text values from
other apps to be used as a value for a variable.

### Response Debugging

There is now an additional option for how to display the response of an HTTP request, which
displays the response body in a fullscreen window but also displays additional meta information
such as response headers, status code and the response time. This should make it easier to
set up or debug shortcuts.

### User Interaction in Scripting

You can now use *alert()*, *prompt()* and *confirm()* as part of the scripting
feature to create flows that require user interaction. These 3 functions work the same way
as you'd expect from a browser.

### Proxy Support

It is now possible to specify an HTTP proxy for each shortcut. Check the "Advanced Technical
Settings" section when creating or editing a shortcut.

### Miscellaneous

- Triggering another shortcut when using scripting is now more reliable and much faster
- HTTP response is ignored if it's not needed, for better performance
- More meaningful error messages are displayed when importing fails

- Improved Chinese and Italian translation
- Improved error handling for importing, exporting and when features are not supported on the device

### Bugfixes

- Content-Type header no longer includes a charset unless explicitly specified
- Shortcuts on launcher icon are kept up-to-date more reliably

## Version 1.27.0
### Quick Settings Tile

The app now has a Quick Settings Tile, which can be used to trigger a shortcut without opening the app and without
going to the home screen. Simply enable the option for one or more shortcuts via the "Misc Settings" menu in the editor.

### Dynamically change icons

There is now a new action "changeIcon" which can be used to change the icon of a shortcut before or after execution. So far
it only supports built-in icons.

### Miscellaneous

### Redesigned Editor

The editor for creating and editing shortcuts was completely redesigned. The many different options are now separated
into their own screens to make the UI easier to navigate.

### JavaScript Code Execution

Previously you were able to add specific actions to be executed before or after a shortcut runs. Now, instead of a static list
of actions, you can run arbitrary JavaScript code, which allows for much more flexibility and more advanced workflows.
On top of that, there are now 2 new actions that can be called directly from within the JavaScript code:


- Added action to show a dialog window with text in it
- Added action to copy text to the clipboard

### Miscellaneous

app settings.

### Require Confirmation

There is now a new option that allows you to mark a shortcut as requiring confirmation.
These shortcuts will prompt you with a confirmation dialog before executing, thereby
preventing accidental execution.

### Miscellaneous

- Added link to FAQ page
- Added partial translation into Catalan
- Added partial translation into Polish

### Bugfixes

- Fixed shortcuts not working when Battery Saver or Data Saver enabled
- Fixed crash when using form-data on Android Marshmallow or older
- Fixed crash when deleting variable

## Version 1.22.0

### Shortcut Placement / Using in Other Apps

You may have encountered a problem when trying to use shortcuts in other apps (e.g. Tasker),
where it would not select or make the other app crash. There is now an alternative method of
selecting a shortcut that you may try in this case. Simply retry selecting the shortcut and
you will be prompted with a dialog that asks you to pick either the new or the old method.

### Longer Timeouts

It is now possible to have request timeouts of up to 10 minutes.

### Bugfixes

- Request body of *multipart/form* requests now correctly uses CRLF instead of only
LF

- Fixed various rare app crashes

## Version 1.21.0

### Shortcut Actions

## Version 1.20.0

### Simplified Variable Insertion

Inserting variables into shortcuts has now become much easier. Each input field that
supports variables now has a button next to it. Clicking it opens a popup dialog with a list
of all available variables, allowing you to easily pick and insert one.

### Improved Tasker Integration

When triggering shortcuts from Tasker, it is now possible to send along variables. Simply
define variables with the same name in Tasker as in your shortcut and their value will
automatically be sent from Tasker to your shortcut when triggered.

### Drag & Drop Reordering

Categories & Variables, as well as options of *select* & *toggle* variables, can
now easily be reordered via drag & drop.

### Improved Specification of Request Body

When specifying the request body of a shortcut, you now have the option to chose between *x-www-form-urlencoded*,
i.e., the body is a list of parameters, or *custom text*, i.e., you specify the request
body as raw text and give it a content-type.

### Variables within Variables!

The *constant*, *toggle* and *select* variable types now support recursive
resolution of values. This means you can reference other variables from these variables. For
example, you could set up a *select* variable where one of the options is a
*color* variable.

### Miscellaneous

- The input field for request parameter values now allows multiline input.
- The cURL export dialog now includes a *copy* button to allow you to quickly copy
the cURL command to the clipboard.
